# PRIVATE NET, PVTNET

Blockchain application, a service provider which will authenticate it's users/devices based on information stored in HYBNET. After authentication, this application provides services to its devices/users.

This is a project to implement IoT Device Authentication using PUF and Blockchain.

**Title :** Decentralised Authentication Protocol for Devices & Users to Access Private Network Services Using Blockchain

**Conference :** 33rd Conference of Open Innovations Association (FRUCT), Zilina, Slovakia, 2023, pp. 46-53, doi: 10.23919/FRUCT58615.2023.10143051.

**Abstract :** With recent advancements in the Internet of things, challenges to secure devices and data related to devices have increased. Adversaries using different threats manage to clone/hack/tamper devices by hacking credentials stored in centralised databases. In this work, a decentralised approach using blockchain is proposed to check the authenticity of the device/user trying to access the services of the service provider network. The proposed method uses public and private blockchain networks and Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) to authenticate the device/user and to store their credentials. The decentralised application runs on Hyperledger Fabric, an open-source platform for building blockchain networks. The proposed protocol is tested and implemented in the physical testbed containing Raspberry Pi and Arduino Mega's.
